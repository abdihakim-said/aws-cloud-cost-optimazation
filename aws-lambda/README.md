### Real-World Scenario: EBS Snapshot Cleanup for Cost Optimization

---

#### **Client Background**
A mid-sized SaaS company, **CloudTech Solutions**, approached our consultancy firm with concerns about their rising AWS costs. The company operates in a fast-paced development environment with multiple teams creating and terminating EC2 instances and EBS volumes daily. Over time, their AWS bill had grown significantly, and they lacked visibility into unused resources contributing to the cost.

---

#### **Problem Faced by the Client**
1. **Accumulation of Stale Snapshots**:
   - Developers frequently created EBS snapshots for backups and testing purposes.
   - Many snapshots were left unused after the associated EC2 instances or volumes were terminated.
   - The client had thousands of snapshots, many of which were no longer relevant.

2. **High Storage Costs**:
   - The client was paying for unused snapshots, which accounted for a significant portion of their AWS bill.

3. **Manual Cleanup Challenges**:
   - Identifying and deleting stale snapshots manually was time-consuming and error-prone.
   - The client lacked an automated process to manage snapshot lifecycle effectively.

4. **Lack of FinOps Practices**:
   - The client had no structured approach to optimize cloud costs or enforce governance over resource usage.

---

#### **Solution Provided**
Our consultancy firm implemented an **automated EBS snapshot cleanup solution** using AWS Lambda and the `boto3` library. The solution was designed to:
- Identify stale snapshots that were no longer associated with active EC2 instances or volumes.
- Automatically delete these snapshots to free up storage and reduce costs.
- Provide a scalable and repeatable process for ongoing cost optimization.

---

#### **Implementation Steps**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - We analyzed the client's AWS environment to understand their snapshot usage patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities.

2. **Script Development**:
   - We developed a Python script that:
     - Retrieved all EBS snapshots owned by the client.
     - Identified snapshots not associated with any active EC2 instances or volumes.
     - Deleted stale snapshots while logging the actions for audit purposes.

3. **Deployment**:
   - The script was deployed as an AWS Lambda function.
   - We configured Amazon EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function daily, ensuring regular cleanup.

4. **IAM Role Configuration**:
   - We created a custom IAM role for the Lambda function with the following permissions:
     - `ec2:DescribeSnapshots`
     - `ec2:DescribeInstances`
     - `ec2:DescribeVolumes`
     - `ec2:DeleteSnapshot`

5. **Monitoring and Reporting**:
   - We enabled AWS CloudWatch logging to monitor the Lambda function's execution and track deleted snapshots.
   - A summary report was shared with the client to provide visibility into cost savings.

---

#### **Outcome**
1. **Cost Savings**:
   - Within the first month, the client saved **$12,000** by deleting over 3,000 unused snapshots.
   - Ongoing savings were projected at **$8,000 per month** as the cleanup process continued.

2. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - The automated solution eliminated the need for manual intervention, saving the client's DevOps team several hours each week.

3. **Improved Governance**:
   - The client gained better visibility into their snapshot usage and implemented a structured process for managing EBS resources.

4. **Alignment with FinOps Goals**:
   - The solution aligned with FinOps principles by optimizing cloud spending and enforcing resource lifecycle management.

---

#### **Client Feedback**
The client was highly satisfied with the solution, stating:
*"This automated cleanup process has not only reduced our AWS costs but also improved our team's efficiency. We now have better control over our cloud resources and can focus on delivering value to our customers."*

---

#### **Key Takeaways**
- **Proactive Cost Management**: Automating the cleanup of unused resources is a critical step in managing cloud costs effectively.
- **Scalable Solutions**: The Lambda-based solution can be easily scaled and adapted to other AWS accounts or regions.
- **FinOps Enablement**: By implementing this solution, the client took a significant step toward adopting FinOps practices, ensuring long-term cost optimization and governance.

---

#### **Next Steps**
To further optimize the client's AWS environment, we recommended:
1. Implementing **tagging policies** to track resource ownership and purpose.
2. Using AWS **Cost Explorer** and **Budgets** to monitor and control spending.
3. Expanding the cleanup process to include other unused resources, such as unattached EBS volumes and idle EC2 instances.

This project demonstrated how a targeted, automated solution can deliver immediate and measurable results, helping clients achieve their cloud cost management goals.
